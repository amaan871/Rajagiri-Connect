Rajagiri connect is a networking platform that enables the students of Rajagiri to form a social network
among themselves, enabling them to connect with their seniors, juniors and faculty for sharing of
information and resources.

 It helps in the development of online social networks by
connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals with similar interests. We plan on
implementing the project as follows :
