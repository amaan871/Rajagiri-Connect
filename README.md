Rajagiri connect is a networking platform that enables the students of Rajagiri to form a social network
among themselves, enabling them to connect with their seniors, juniors and faculty for sharing of
information and resources.

 It helps in the development of online social networks by
connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals with similar interests. We plan on
implementing the project as follows :
- Front End : Flutter
- Back End : Firebase


## Features
- The user is able to create an account for themselves with the required details and areas of interest
- It provides teachers with features such as posting a notice or an image that can be viewed by all others with an account.
- Separate pages for posting notices and images are provided within the application.
- The students will have the facility to view all the updates and information passed on by the teachers.
